## Challenge 3

- [ ] `editProfile`: Change the user's profile, this includes changing passwod and changing the avatarURL.
- [ ] `login`: Log the user in by returning a JWT or return an error in case the password is wrong.
- [ ] `seeProfile`: See any users profile.

You will also have to write some code to **protect** your resolvers and **inject** the logged in user to the resolver's **context**.
